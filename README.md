## 🚀 About Me

Hey, I’m Rishabh Panwar 👋
A backend-focused developer who loves building secure, scalable, and real-world ready applications. I primarily work on the backend, but I’m also comfortable building modern frontends when needed. From REST APIs to authentication systems and third-party integrations, I focus on writing clean, maintainable, and production-grade code.

What I do:

⚙️ Develop scalable backends with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and JWT

🎨 Build modern frontends using React, Redux, HTML, and CSS (backend-first, full-stack capable)

🔐 Build complete auth systems (OTP verification, refresh tokens, role-based access)

📁 Strong believer in clean architecture (MVC, services, middleware) and testable code
